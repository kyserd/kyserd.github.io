## About Notes

Notes are where micro snippet like posts go. But it is very likely that
this part of the website will get culled for not being used.

You can [subscribe to this page via RSS]($link.page('notes').alternative('rss')).

This page lists entries for the current year, for past entries consult the
[notes archive](/notes/).


## [Notes not devlog]($section.id("2025-05-31T00:00:00"))
In the default configuration this page is meant to be a devlog,
which I think it does quite well. If this was a website for an actual
product I'd quite enjoy using it.

But since it is not I've decided to adept it to a micro blogging format.
However it remains to be seen whether or not I actually will use it.
