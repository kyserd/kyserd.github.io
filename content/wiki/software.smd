I use a lot of software and it helps to keep it mostly
consistant among development environments. This is not
comprehensive and has signficant overlap with my [Void Install](/wiki/void-install).

## Programming
* editor: helix
* ssh-agent: keychain

## System
* shell: fish
* window manager: sway
* terminal: foot (switch to ghostty?)
* font: Iosevka
* audio: pipewire
* flatpak

### Sway stuff
* launcher: wofi
* display: kanshi
* status-bar: i3status-rust
* login manager: greetd using gtkgreet

### Games
* PrismLauncher (Flatpak)
* Steam: [Install Instructions](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/external-applications.html#steam)
