I would hesitate to call these assorted writings tutorials. They are more so a
way for me to write down the steps and decisions I make when installing something,
helpful links I come across, or how I fix things.

Too often I forget exactly how I manged to do something and then can't recreate it.
While not offering the same reproducibility of something like NixOS, the hope is
that my setup becomes more consistant across all my different computers and is
easier to keep organized.

As always, these "tutorials" come with absolutely no warrenty of any kind.
