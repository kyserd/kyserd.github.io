Where to place files: the guide.

## Root directory

### /opt/
There is some software out there (for example Vivado) that greatly prefers to be installed
in its desired location, usually /opt/. Even though it requires root permission software
thats wants to go in /opt/ gets to go in /opt/.

## Home Directory

### ~/dev/
For your development needs and git repos.

#### ~/dev/external/

This is where projects that you didn't create and don't plan
to contribute to should go.

### ~/.config/
Config file locations. If they must they can go in ~/ but stuffing
them into ~/.config/ is preferred.


### ~/.local/

Pretend be local root directory almost.

#### ~/.local/appimages/
If you need to install an appimage this is where it should go.

#### ~/.local/bin/
#### ~/.local/pkgs/
Software pulled out of tree that is installed on the system.
The difference between this and ~/.local/opt/ is that only
the software package (source) should be here, no executables.

#### ~/.local/opt/
Tarballed software (not built from source) that needs to install in
its own designated folder with file structure. Many games go in here
along with software like Ghidra.
