I've used Firefox as a web browser for the longest time. But in the recent
year there have been a few contriversies surronding Mozilla and their policy
around advertising and selling personal data. Some people suggest that Firefox
is no longer worth using, maybe, but its what I use currently. But I've decided
to at least try to somewhat harden my installation.

Now I've seen suggestions that one could switch to a more privacy focused browser,
some of the names I've seen are LibreFox, WaterFox, and Floorp, which are all Firefox
derivatives. However, since I already use identifiying features like Firefox sync, I'm
not to keen to immediately switch to a browser that would break my current Firefox setup.
For non-Firefox alternatives, I find them less compelling, I've seen Brave come up a few
times but given their [troubled history](https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1j1pq7b/list_of_brave_browser_controversies/)
I'm not particularly interested in trying.

In the end one must decide where their boundry in terms of privacy, useability, and security lies.
In terms of mainstream browsers, there's not one that I know of that doesn't have some form of
problem. Firefox stands for a lot of good things and getting tracked by them for advertising
purposes isn't the absolute worst thing in the world. I'm not happy with it and in a better world
I wouldn't need to make the tradeoff, but when I use an android device, gmail, and google maps on the daily,
I've already traded part of my privacy in exchange for convenience.

But that doesn't mean that I shouldn't try to improve my privacy.
