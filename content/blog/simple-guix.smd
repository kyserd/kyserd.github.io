## Why Guix

I've been interested in NixOS for a while now. The idea of being able to declare packages and my system has always been something that excited me.
Too often do I end up installing a new system, spending some time setting it up, encountering an issue that takes a lot of googling and time to fix,
and using the system for around a year before it starts falling apart and then doing this whole charade over again. Having a declaritive system would
be the cure for the disease that is my bad desicion making. 

I am also however, not interested in making more problems for myself. Theoretically if I was a Nix wizard, this would not be a problem, I would be able
to bend every FHS conforming program to my will and live in a perfectly declaritive world. I am not a Nix wizard and I unfortunately do not have the time
to become one. What I'm interested in is something that will save me more time down the line then the problems it/I will create. To be frank I want something
that just works, but with Linux that unfortunately is rarely the case.

So I've been exploring other systems and tools that can help me achieve this goal. The Universal Blue project piqued my interest, but my first experience with it
was marred by this Wayland bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/2967. Not the Universal Blue project's fault, but when my first experience booting
the system is having my monitor start having a seizure it has already created more problems that it has solved. I'll definitly give it another shot sometime soon,
but for the moment I've been looking elsewhere. That elsewhere has been Guix.

Now to be clear, I'm not talking about the Guix-SD (the Guix NixOS equivilant), but just Guix on-top of an already installed Linux distro. The sole reason for giving
Guix layered on another system a try first compared to layered Nix is that I don't understand the Nix language and trying to understand it made my head hurt. I'd much
rather learn a Lisp like Guile which is more likely to let me leverage my previous programming experience.

Also the whole flakes debacle did not help when I was trying to get a bare minimum reproducible setup going. I have no horse in the flake race,
but boy did I get desicion paralysis trying to figure out if I should use them or not.

So I had one goal with Guix, a declarative setup that let me install packages on another Linux system for my user, preferably using home-environment. It took a fair bit of
reading, but I managed to create a simple Guix Home base for installing and pinning packages. The resources that helped the most with this were:
- https://guix.gnu.org/manual/
- https://systemcrafters.net/craft-your-system-with-guix/
- https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/issues/431#issuecomment-5528810

The setup I ended up with looked like this:
```
~/dotfiles/
├── .config
│   └── guix
│       ├── channels-lock.scm
│       └── channels.scm
├── home
│   └── home-config.scm
└── justfile  
```

To get the `channels.scm` to begin with you can just do `guix describe --format=channels > ~/dotfiles/.config/guix/channels.scm`, just make sure you delete the commit inforamation afterwards!
The commit tags will be living in `channels-lock.scm` instead.

Only three Guix files and a justfile for ease of use. The justfile simply provided an easy way to update and pull the guix channel and a way to build and switch the home manager.
```make
guix-profile := `guix time-machine -C .config/guix/channels-lock.scm`    
guix := guix-profile / "bin/guix"

list:
    @just --list

guix-update:
    {{guix}} time-machine -C .config/guix/channels.scm -- describe --format=channels > .config/guix/channels-lock.scm

guix-pull:
    {{guix}} pull -C .config/guix/chanels-lock.scm

home-build:
    {{guix}} home build home/home-config.scm

home-switch:
    {{guix}} home reconfigure home/home-config.scm

stow:
    stow --target ~/.config .config
```

This is all that is needed to achieve pinned channels in Guix! The genius is the use of time-machine, when we pass it the `channels-lock.scm`, it uses the pinned channels, but when we pass
it the unpinned `channels.scm`, it will default to the latest commit thus updating those channels! Combined with a git repository you'll be able to reset your lock file to any previous version
allowing for easy rollbacks in case something breaks.

The home configuration is also very simple, it's probably not ideal and could be more "idiomatic" but it gets the job done
```scheme
(use-modules (gnu)
             (gnu home))
(home-environment
  (packages (specifications->packages
              (list "git"
                    "tmux"
                    "helix"
                    "just"
                    "fish"))))
```

That's it! That's all you need to get declaritive layered Guix packages on any Linux system. Having Guix installed also gives us easy access to `guix shell`! Want to use the justfile to
build your home-environment but don't have it installed? Just do `guix shell --check just` and you'll be dropped into a shell with Just installed.

Now there are still a few things that require atttention, one of which is the fact that layered Guix requires some special attention to LibC locales (as seen in https://systemcrafters.net/craft-your-system-with-guix/installing-the-package-manager/#setting-the-locale-correctly), but overall this simple base is all you need to get started!
