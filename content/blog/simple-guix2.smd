## The Good
I've been expirimenting with guix home for a little while in a strive to have a less brittle
setup. It's overall been quite a pleasant expirience and I created a little [sample configuration](https://github.com/kyserd/guix-home-example)
that makes it easy to bootstrap home on a new install.

It's overall quite simple and with the help of guix shell has made it easy to self bootstrap.
I can use configuratio tools like `stow` and `just` to make managing the install easier without
having to create a seperate process for bootstrapping said tools. As soon as I can activate the pinned
guix binary I can create temporary shells containing the exact versions of `stow` and `just` my system
needs and then can use my already existing justfile to bootstrap the rest.

## The Bad
There is no bad but I just wanted to include section to make the section pun work :^)

## The Ugly
The bootstrapping in my opinion is super neat and I'd love to use this on my setups, but I've run into an issue which is
unfortunatly a bit of a deal breaker. Guix is slow. Not slow to the point where I can't use it, but it takes longer to install then the
OS itself. This is exacerbated by the fact that Guix 1.4.0, the latest release of Guix at the moment, doesn't support git redirects.
Guix transitioned from Savannah to Codeberg this year and that greatly improved the useability. But since redirects aren't supported,
one must update from Savannah first, which is unbearably slow.

There was a [consensus](https://consensus.guix.gnu.org/gcd/005-regular-releases.html) reached within Guix to start with
regular releases, which should hopefully solve or at least improve the speed problem. But until that happends, the dream
of having a quick and reproducible setup I can use in VM's or on real hardware with Guix Home is dead.

I don't plan to
abandon Guix forever, but for the moment I will be investigating alternatives as I don't want to wait 10-15 minutes just to
have 7 programs be installed and setup (especially if this is a one-shot VM instance).
