This is my website where I can post things that I find interesting,
or just my own thoughts. Though the postings will be almost entirely tech
related.

A quick overview of the site:
 - [Blog](/blog/): A collection of posts about assorted topics.
 - [Wiki](/wiki/): My collection of notes and reminders.
 - [Notes](/notes/): Shorter posts that don't warrent their own entries.

## Projects

### [Unholy C](https://github.com/JBourds/unholy_c)
A compiler for a subset of C17 created while reading Nora Sandler's
[Writing a C Compiler](https://norasandler.com/2024/08/20/The-Book-Is-Here.html).

The natural complement to Holy C. What makes it unholy? Well, it's C.
